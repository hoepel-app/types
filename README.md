# @hoepel.app/types: Models and interfaces

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hoepel-app/types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hoepel-app/types)

This repository houses the TS models used in `hoepel.app`. 

Slowly, things are being moved out of this repo and to [the monorepo](https://github.com/hoepel-app/hoepel-app).
